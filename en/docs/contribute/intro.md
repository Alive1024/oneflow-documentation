As an open source infrastructure with prominent core competitiveness and high barriers, OneFlow is still in rapid iteration and progress. 

OneFlow can't grow without the friends who love open source. Every line of code you contribute, every issue you submit, every bug you report, even every question you ask, is precious to our OneFlow. 

## Grow up with OneFlow

Whether it's contributing code, adding API document, fixing bugs and issues, reviewing code...etc

OneFlow looks forward to your help in every way. 

You can participate in OneFlow's open source project by choosing one or more of the following, depending on your situation. 

* Contribute code
* Contribute test case
* Add API document
* Review Pull Request
* Recommend OneFlow to people who in need
* Participate in OneFlow's group discussion
* …… All the things you can think of to make OneFlow better


## Contribute code

Our main open source code repository are：

* [oneflow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow)：Including complete code of OneFlow 
* [OneFlow-Benchmark](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/OneFlow-Benchmark)：Including multiple models(including scripts, documents, data preprocess, etc) made by OneFlow

You can also find [here](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc) or create more OneFlow open source projects.  

## Contribute test case

OneFlow has reproduced and tested a lot of popular models, some related scripts and documents are placed in [OneFlow-Benchmark](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/OneFlow-Benchmark) repository. 

But OneFlow has more models that are not covered, so we are expecting you to migrate models in OneFlow. 

We also strongly to use OneFlow to implement your own original research, and share it in [OneFlow-Benchmark. 

## Add API documents

OneFlow's API documents use `sphinx` to extract the function annotation and docstring. 

The API documents are placed in docs directory under the [oneflow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow) repository, we can generate it as the following scripts. 

```shell
cd oneflow/docs && make dev
```

We are looking forward to your help, Add `docstring` and `function annotation` for [OneFlow Python API](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow/tree/develop/oneflow/python). 

## Review

With the mentality of shaping art works, we are committed to making OneFlow into a basic software product which is full of industrial beauty. This process is also inseparable from the open source community OneFlow code review.

We are looking forward to your submission of more issues, Pull Requests and reviews in each code repository. We are also looking forward to your participation in OneFlow on its way forward.
