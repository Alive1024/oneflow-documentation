# OneFlow New Generation Deep Learning Framework

## What
OneFlow is an open source deep learning framework using new frame design and the world's leading technology on distributed system.

## Why

* New experience of distributed training. Make multi-machines and multi-cards simple as solo card.

* Perfectly support container framework(k8s + docker)

* Support huge model in naive way

* Zero-copy during runtime

* Linear speedup

* Flexible support for multiple deep learning compiler

* Automatic mixed precision

* Continuous improvement in operator library, model library, etc.

We are trying to build a deep learning framework that will amaze everyone. We look forward to your use, feedbacks and participation.

## How to start

How to install and quickstart of OneFlow can be learnt in [quick start](build_ship/install.md).

How to use OneFlow to tackle the common task of machine learning can be found in [basic topics](basics_topics/data_input.md). Such as, building network,  hyper-parameters configuration, loading data, distributed training and so on.

The topics about characteristics of OneFlow can be found in [extended topic](extended_topics/job_function_define_call.md). Such as, the format of OneFlow's data set, parallelism view of OneFlow and how to debug OneFlow framework by vscode.

In [advance examples](adv_examples/resnet.md), we introduce models in [OneFlow Model Zoo repository](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/OneFlow-Benchmark). It is helpful for users to understand the models and other details.

We look forward to machine learning developers and geeks to  participate in the [OneFlow open sources project](contribute/intro.md). Perfect deep learning framework will come from our joint efforts.
